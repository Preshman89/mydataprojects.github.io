									<h2><a href="#">Nestle Products Analytics</a></h2>
									<p>This project was unique as the whole business expansion plan and introduction
										of new products was dependent on the product comparison dashboard/insights. A look into
									   the performance of the current products was instrumental to achieving this results.
									   I was able to identify the products that are leading the market in all regions, the period of high 
									   demands, best sales medium by countries and sales revenue by location etc.
									   This helped the growth and strategy team make informed decisions. This was done using PowerBI
